I am currently a Data Scientist at [ViFive](https://vifive.co), a vision AI health platform tailored to provide musculoskeletal care. I've been deep diving into projects like improving 3d pose estimation models, optimizing data operations to improve training efficiency, developing functional test pipeline to help clinicians save their time, and more! (check out [cv page](/cv) to see what I've done!)

I am fascinated by delivering ML models that make real-world impact! My current expertise is in computer vision, especially pose estimation, but I believe it could be anything in the near future! I'm more than excited to explore fields and techniques I've never been exposed to.

Before ViFive, I completed my Master's in Data Science at the University of San Francisco, while doing part-time work with the New York Mets. I received my B.A. in Statistics from the University of California, Berkeley, and did a few internships back in Korea.
